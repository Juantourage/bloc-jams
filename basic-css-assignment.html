        <p>The difference between absolute and relative positioning is this: Relative positioning is very basic. It is very similar to the boring "static" position, but only superficially. Underneath the boring "Static" look that relative position has, it can actually do some pretty cool things such as adjusting using offset properties, meaning that you can individually affect the behavior of the "relative" element. Relative positioning can also create coordinate systems for child elements which is just a fancy way of saying that we can affect elements within elements using relative positioning.</p>
        <p>Absolute is entirely different. The reason being is that while relative positioning has boundaries, absolute positioning doesn't. You can pretty much do whatever you want with absolute positioning and it can also do what relative positioning does. </p>
        
        <p>"Box-sizing: border-box"(option1) is different from the standard "box-sizing"(option2), because option1 gives you more control over the browser and what you put in it. With option2, the browser changes the dimensions of the padding but with option1, you can make all the dimensions exactly the widths and lengths that you want. </p>
